## ¿Que Bola?

I’m xCBNZ, a ITI Student  based in Barcelona, Spain.
I love turning ideas that pop into my mind into real projects ✨

Whenever inspiration hits — I start coding 😜

Right now, my main stack is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I’m currently learning React, Tailwind, TypeScript, and Next.js.

This repo is where I share my progress, growth, and projects and hopefully, collaborate with others along the way 💪

A few facts about me:
- 🇩🇪🇨🇺 German/Cuban
- 🎶 I make music
- 🥦 Vegetarian
- 💜 Favorite color: purple
- ☕ Coffee is my fuel
- 🔄 I can solve a Rubik’s Cube in under 20 seconds 😄
